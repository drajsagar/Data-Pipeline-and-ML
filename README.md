# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

## Project Motivation
In this project I have used the skills I learned through data engineering to analyze disaster message data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

Also, built a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories
